# CLAUDE.md — Ticklr (Monorepo)

## What This Repo Is

Ticklr is a privacy-first personal network manager with two native platform implementations.
All data is stored on-device. No cloud, no analytics, no account required.

## Feature Parity Status

| Feature | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| Contact import (phone + LinkedIn CSV) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Groups / circles | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tickle calendar (recurring reminders) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Compose SMS/MMS with templates | ✅ | ✅ |
| Settings | ✅ | ✅ |
| Unit tests | — | ✅ (3 suites) |
| App icon (Pulse identity) | ✅ | ✅ Adaptive icon |
| Debug seed / clear contacts | ✅ | ✅ |
| Store-ready | ⚠️ TestFlight pending | ⚠️ Signing pending |

## Debug Tools (gated by DEBUG flag — not in release builds)

Both platforms have a **Debug section** in Settings:
- **Load Test Contacts** — seeds 20 fake contacts from `assets/seed/test_contacts.csv`
- **Clear All Contacts** — wipes all contacts with confirmation (iOS only so far)

iOS: gated by `#if DEBUG` in `SettingsView.swift` via `SeedDataService.swift`
Android: gated by `BuildConfig.DEBUG` in `SettingsViewModel.kt` via `SeedDataService.kt`

## Platform-Specific Notes

**iOS** — `MFMessageComposeViewController` always requires user tap to send. No silent send possible.
**Android** — `SmsManager` can send silently with SEND_SMS permission. Intent fallback also available.

> Android's silent SMS send is a meaningful UX advantage. Surface as a user preference in Settings.

## 🚧 Next Feature: Group Member Selection — Add Confirmation Toast

### Problem
When a user picks a person from the contact list to add to a group, the contact disappears from
the list immediately with no feedback. This is confusing — the user doesn't know if the action
succeeded or where the contact went.

### Solution
Show a brief, unobtrusive **toast/snackbar** message after a contact is added to a group.

**Message format:**
- Short group name: `"John User added to Hiking Crew"`
- Long group name (>20 chars): `"John User added to group"` (truncate group name, use generic fallback)

**Behavior:**
- Auto-dismisses after ~2 seconds
- Non-blocking — user can keep selecting contacts
- Appears at the bottom of the screen (above tab bar on iOS, standard snackbar position on Android)
- Uses existing brand colors: Cobalt `#2563EB` background, white text

### Group Name Character Limit
To prevent overflow in toasts, labels, and list rows, enforce a **30-character maximum** on group names.
- Show character count in the group name text field (e.g., `"12 / 30"`)
- Disable save if name is empty or exceeds 30 characters
- Apply on both create and edit flows

### Scope
This feature must be implemented on **both iOS and Android** with matching UX behavior.
See platform CLAUDE.md files for implementation details.
